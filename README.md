# Executive Summary

For this project, I will mainly focus on detecting and classifying different species of flowers from a flowers dataset. I will be creating a nueral network model that will be able to identify and classify different species of flowers.

## Problem Statement <a name="problem_statement"></a>

<p></p>
I thought it would be interesting to create a nueral network model that could detect different flower species and be classified correctly. If this model can detect flowers correctly it can also detect different image correctly after it has had sufficient training data.

# Analysis <a name="analysis"></a>

## Data Cleaning <a name="data_cleaning"></a>

Thankfully this dataset did not contain any null values. Overall this dataset was clean from the start so minimal cleaning had to be made.

For the modeling processes I used Keras Neural Network to detect different species of flowers.

The nueral network was built using several differnt layers. The model was soon compiled and we set cetrain parameters like accuracy for metrics. 
## Results <a name="results"></a>

Here are the results of the Nueral Network.

Currently the model only predicts with a 23% accuracy. However, we can always try to change different parameters to see if we can achive better results.  

We can possibly achieve better resutls by performing some parameter tuning. This is where we change different parameters in the model to see how the results differ.

There is some work that needs to be done, but this is a great start to learning about Nueral Networks.
